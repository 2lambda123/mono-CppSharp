This is my custom fork of Mono.Cxxi that aims to replace the GCC-XML parser
with a Clang-based one, and remove all the C++-ABI specific code for things
like object layout and name mangling from the runtime library while replacing
it with metadata generated by Clang (it already provides all the needed info).
